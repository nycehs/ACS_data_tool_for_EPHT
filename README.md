# ACS data download tool for EPHT NYC
This tool was authored by Gretchen Culp and updated with the help of Vishal Bedre, Douglas Kim, and Meredith Eddy at NYC DOHMH. 

It makes it easy to download NYC data from the ACS API, and it aggregates the data by various geographies, then formats it for upload into the Environment and Helath Data portal.
